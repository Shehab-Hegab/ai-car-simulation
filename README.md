# 🚗 AI Car Simulation with Neural Networks & Genetic Algorithm

This project simulates a self-driving car controlled by an evolving artificial intelligence system. It uses **neural networks** trained through a **genetic algorithm** to enable cars to learn to navigate a road autonomously — all built in JavaScript with interactive browser visualization.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

* **Goal**: Train an AI-controlled car to drive independently using neural networks and evolutionary learning.
* **Approach**: Implemented a genetic algorithm to evolve the neural networks generation by generation.
* **Visualization**: Real-time browser-based simulation with visual feedback on sensors and decision-making.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

* 🧬 **Neural Network + Genetic Algorithm**
  Each car is controlled by a neural network. The best-performing networks are selected and mutated to form the next generation.

* 🚘 **Sensor-Based Navigation**
  Cars detect walls and obstacles using simulated sensors and adjust movement based on neural outputs.

* 🎮 **Interactive Simulation**
  Built entirely in HTML/CSS/JavaScript with real-time visuals of performance and learning behavior.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML / CSS / JavaScript**
* **Canvas API** – for rendering simulation graphics.
* **Vanilla JS** – for neural network, physics, and genetic algorithm logic.
